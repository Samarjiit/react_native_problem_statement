This README provides an overview of the mobile app project and its features. The project aims to create a mobile app with various functionalities including navigation, background images, camera usage, location capturing, API integration, and local storage management.

## Features

1. **Footer Navigation**: The app includes a footer navigation bar with four screens: Home, Camera, Location, and List with API data.

2. **Header with Sample Text**: All screens include a header with sample text for visual identification.

3. **Background Image on Home Screen**: The Home screen features a background image to enhance visual appeal.

4. **Image Scrolling Banner**: A scrolling banner with five images is implemented on the Home screen to showcase different images.

5. **Camera Integration**: Users can capture a selfie using the device camera, and the captured image can be displayed on any screen within the app.

6. **Location Capture**: The app captures the user's current location and displays it on one of the screens.

7. **Local File Management**: A `data.json` file is added to the project folder. Users can read and save the file content in the local storage of the device. The file content is then displayed on any screen within the app.

8. **API Integration**: The app integrates with a sample API (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`) to fetch data. A loader is displayed while loading data from the API to provide feedback to the user.

9. **Styling and Theming**: Native Base theme or any other suitable theme is used to style the app, making it visually interactive and appealing.
